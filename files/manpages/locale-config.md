# NAME

locale-config - Simple locale configuration utility

# SYNOPSIS

locale-config

# DESCRIPTION

`locale-config` -- also available by its intended alias `0` -- is a simple
command line menu utility designed to configure the console keyboard and
language settings. As a (potentially misconfigured) keyboard is required to run
this utility, `0` was chosen to minimize the number of keys needed to configure
the keyboard:

  - 0
  - Enter
  - Arrow keys

Once run, keyboard changes should take effect immediately, but you must restart
current shells for language changes to take effect.

# OPTIONS

None.

# BUGS

None known, many assumed.
